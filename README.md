Well, i don't know if you @vdanen will be watching these kind of test, so i'm working here
from know and all that irrelevant questions will be moved out in next reviews!!
The distribution i've installed are Jessie from Debian 8.4. Testing the default apps
to move around all that fremawork that 'email' is.

As you can imagine the email doesn't work at my workstation, because if it do i'll emailed
to you. 
Gui here is blowed up. So i don't have X as like other similar stuff. Just shells.
In that scenario i know that some thing frome your repo(mailcap and similar...) doesn' work too.

I will be hapy if the filters and cAV becomes to something usefull!!
